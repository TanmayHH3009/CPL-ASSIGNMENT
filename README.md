# CPL-ASSIGNMENTS

**CPL Assignment 1**:  Implement ‘BigInt’ data type with operations (+, -, *) for supporting 1024 bit integers. Stored The 1024 bit Number in Array of type Long Long int

**CPL Assignment 2:**  Write a program to implement heap management scheme. Implement the ‘allocate’ and ‘free’ functions. Ensure that adjacent free blocks are merged together. Used **First Fit** Technique                         of memory  allocation.

**CPL Assignment 3**: Write a code to support implementation of a symbol table with nested scopes using a hash table. Maintain a new symbol table for every scope and link it with the surrounding scope.                            Provide functionality to insert and lookup for a variable in the current scope hash table. If the variable entry does not exist in the current scope hash table, look up the value in                          the surrounding scope. Represented Symbol Table Using Linked List.

**CPL Assignment 4**: Write a C source code having at least one function call and function definition. Analyse the assembled output (both the optimized and the non-optimized versions). 
                      Submit your C source code and a word document describing the analysed output.
